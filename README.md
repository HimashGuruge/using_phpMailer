# PHPMiler

Welcome to **PHPMiler**, a PHP-based mailer project designed to send emails efficiently using PHP. This project is fully functional when run on a local server or a compatible hosting environment. However, it does **not work** when hosted directly on GitHub due to GitHub's static hosting limitations, which do not support server-side PHP execution.

## Status
- **Local Environment**: Working ✅
- **GitHub Hosting**: Not Working ❌ (GitHub Pages only supports static content, not server-side scripts like PHP)
